<p align="center"> E-commerce personal project. The purpose of this short project was to get familiar with new gen coding language, and other dependable framework such as Clerk, or Prisma, and Next.js.

I found it interesting to test new tech and with the many content I find on youtube, i am never out of ideas.
I am also a big fan of the new gen coding language, and i am always looking for new tech to learn and test.
